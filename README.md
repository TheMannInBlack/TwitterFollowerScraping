# TwitterFollowerScraping
Scrape the accounts of those who follow a specific account

This is broken down into three pieces of code. It takes about one second to download each accounts data. This is very time consuming.
In order to cut down on time a list of usernames is downloaded. Then it is split into 5 different csv documents. The csv documents
are then loaded into separate windows of my editor (Spyder). Each window is ran individually then at the end the results are combined
back into one csv. That CSV can then be filtered by various profile criteria to identify potential customers.
